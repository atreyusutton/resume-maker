### Layout
The application uses a **split-screen layout**:

- **Right Side**: Live preview showing how the resume will look

### Editing Process
1. **Section Management**: Each section has a checkbox to include/exclude it from the final resume
2. **Drag & Drop**: Use the grip handle (â‹®â‹®) to drag sections to reorder them
3. **Individual Items**: Within sections like Experience and Skills, each item can be individually enabled/disabled
4. **Rich Text**: Use the formatting toolbar to add bold, italic, and links to text content

### Data Structure
The app maintains a structured data model where each section has:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `type`: Section type (personal, experience, etc.)
- `enabled`: Whether the section is included
- `order`: Display order (managed by drag & drop)
- `data`: Section-specific content

### Export Functionality
- **PDF Generation**: Converts the preview into a high-quality PDF
- **Filename**: Automatically uses your name for the PDF filename
- **Styling**: Maintains professional formatting in the exported PDF
